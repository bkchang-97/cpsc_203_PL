  <p> In the Practice Examlet, you were asked to design a member function for <code>shirt</code> called <code>fold</code>. We will take this idea one step further. Design a dataclass called <code>closet</code> that has one field called <code>shirts</code>. Then design a member function called <code>foldShirts</code> that will fold every shirt in the closet.

      We understand that coding perfectly, with no feedback, is very difficult on an exam. We will be hand marking any code that does not pass the autograding system.
