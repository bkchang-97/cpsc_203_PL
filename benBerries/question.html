  <p> Ben enjoys going berry picking at Krauss berry farm. Unfortunately the farm has imposed a new policy for calculating costs. The farm is switching from a by-weight to a by-number-of-berries system. Therefore Ben will need to know the exact number of each berry he has at the moment he approaches the pay station. Currently he has 20 <code>strawberries</code>, 65 <code>blueberries</code>, 32 <code>blackberries</code> and 29 <code>raspberries</code>. Create a dictionary called <code>bens_berries</code> that keeps track of his berry counts at the moment. </p>
